<p>Most of us adults feel stress or anxiety for some time at least daily. It is the reaction towards the unknown based on the fears of losing or the  probability of a negative outcome. Nothing beats this feelings like real live action.</p>
<br>
<p>Breaking out to face our fears for the new world experiences to explore and be  adventurous is human nature. Tasting different foods, facing the camera, traveling to places we haven’t been before and making connections  pushes us to new boundaries. Having written that, it is also our innate  character to desire to be in a neutral state with fewer levels of  anxiety and stress.</p>

<p>Words motivating us to get out of our comfort zone are flooding on Instagram  and elsewhere. It adorns the spaces of wall arts to tattoos to coffee  mugs. There are also a few rebels slowly starting to express against  coming out of their zones and they are happy to be in it. Now, what is  the decision we should make? Should we stay in or step out of the  comfort zone?</p>
<br>

<h2 id="Defining the comfort zone">Defining the comfort zone</h2>
<p>Firstly, the term comfort zone origination is hard to be traced. Many sources  say it could be from the temperature range within which one feels cozy.  The comfort zone is the plane at which we act with a lack of difficulty  and familiarity. Probably gained through routine and therefore, it is no more unusual or surprising.</p>
<br>
<p>In 1907, psychobiologist Robert Yerkes who studied animal and human  behavior had tested with mice that portrayed ‘their innate habit of  running around, describing greater or smaller circles or more frequently whirling around on the same spot with incredible rapidity’.</p>
<br>
<p>He concluded that in mice, ‘anxiety improves performance until a certain  optimum level of arousal has been reached’. From which we can understand that to perform highly, one has to undergo good stress. To raise your  focus and drive which will eventually sustain you in sudden  unanticipated situations. He also stated, ‘beyond the optimal point,  performance deteriorates as higher levels of anxiety are attained’.</p>
<br>
<p><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/28/709/151">The dancing mouse study</a> reveals that it is important to step out of your comfort zone and it  benefits one. Also, what I understand from this behavior of mice is  after reaching out we need to rest to avoid burnout. So it is getting  back to our comfort zone. I would say it is best to go the Buddha  way here. Stick to balance. We need to get to our psychological state  where we can be most true to ourselves, rest and recharge.</p>
<br>
<p>In 2009, Management theorist Alasdair White, examined the [comfort zone theory](<a href="http://www.whiteandmaclean.eu/uploaded_files/120120109110852performance_management-final290110(2)-preview.pdf)">http://www.whiteandmaclean.eu/uploaded_files/120120109110852performance_management-final290110(2)-preview.pdf)</a> where he concluded, “Both motivation and anxiety are, behaviorally,  sub-sets of stress and, consequently, they are tools to assist in  performance management — there will be times when motivation will be the most useful tool, while at others the introduction of anxiety will be  more appropriate. However, too much motivation or anxiety will result in too much stress and this will result in performance being disabled”.</p>
<br>
<p>Though, a 2017 <a href="https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/29208/6/Corbett_finalproof_.pdf">study</a> reveals there is no facts to back this conclusion. But, again this  management theory reveals good stress within the correct levels can be  best practice models in workplaces.</p>
<br>
<p>We have our convenient territories, each different from one. The to and  fro activity blurs our different zone boundaries leading to the main  objective. It is to achieve the optimal level so that we get used to our new sphere to expand our comfort zone.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Benefits of expanding your comfort zone.">Benefits of expanding your comfort zone.</h2>
<p>It challenges one to walk on the path of personal development. It enhances mental health and increases your creativity and pace. We don’t  necessarily have to do wild daring things like climbing Mount Everest,  but simply doing some of our daily activities differently is a great  place to start with. Taking a different route to work, reading an  offbeat genre of book, having a new haircut or tapping into creativity  by joining a glass painting class are some of the steps one could make.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, we should remember to do what we want to do, with little changes every  day and the needed amount of stress with rests. The circumference of our comfort level will increase making one feel alive and good.</p>
