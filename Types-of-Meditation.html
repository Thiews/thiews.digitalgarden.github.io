            <h1 id="Types of Meditation">Types of Meditation</h1>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@psychicstudent">Psychic Student</a>, 28/03/2019</p>
<br>
<p>When  you’re starting to meditate, you need to be comfortable, know that you  won’t be disturbed and know that there is no right or wrong way to do  it. As you practice, become more confident and start to feel the  benefits of meditation, you may want to start exploring different types  of meditation and different types of meditation techniques.</p>
<br>
<p>Here are just a few of the many types of meditation with a brief explanation of each one.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Breathing Meditation">Breathing Meditation</h2>
<p>This meditation could be where the phrase “take a breather” originated.</p>
<br>
<p>It’s  a very simple and easy meditation where you sit comfortably and just  focus on your breathing. You can breathe normally or breathe in through  your nose and out through your mouth. This is a useful little meditation  to do if you get a few quiet moments during a busy day and need to calm  down or recharge your batteries.</p>
<br>
<p>If all else fails — lock yourself in the loo at work and take those breaths. You’ll feel much better for it!</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="Buddhist Meditation">Buddhist Meditation</h2>
<p>Buddhist  meditations encourage and develop concentration and clarity. They focus  on gaining emotional positivity, and a calmness which allows you to see  the true nature of things. If practiced regularly, these nurtured  states of mind can help you to feel deeply peaceful and yet energized.  People who practice Buddhism meditation say that it can be life  transforming and it gives them a new understanding of life.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Chakra Meditation">Chakra Meditation</h2>
<p>In  this chakra balancing meditation, you start with the first chakra, the  root and work your way slowly up to your crown chakra. At every chakra,  you visualize the spinning energy wheel and focus on healing and  aligning it. Once you’re happy that it’s done, move up to the next one.</p>
<br>
<p>This is a powerful meditation which leaves you feeling energized, balanced and connected.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="Colouring Meditation">Colouring Meditation</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>Have you ever watched a child with a colouring book and noticed how completely absorbed they become?</p>
<br>
<p>Well  now there’s colouring for grown-ups. Amazon has got an amazing  selection of books with outlines of mandalas, stained glass windows,  abstract patters and more so if it appeals to you, then you will be  spoiled for choice.</p>
<br>
<p>Most of them have been compiled by Art Therapists and reviewers are reporting stress relief and a joyous zoning out.</p>
<br>
<p>Just get some coloured pencils and lose yourself in the meditative practice of colouring.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Deep Meditation">Deep Meditation</h2>
<p>This  is the goal that you are working towards. When your meditations become  deeper, you will be less aware of your surroundings and will be able to  focus on where the meditation takes you. It’s a bit like learning to  drive. One day you wonder how you’ll ever do it — and then suddenly, you  can drive the car and look where you’re going at the same time!</p>
<br>
<p>After  a deep meditation, you actually “come back to Earth with a bump” and  your physical body feels extremely heavy, restrictive and burdonsome.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Guided Meditation">Guided Meditation</h2>
<p>In  this meditation, you listen to a voice that guides you through from  start to finish. Guided meditations are ideal for beginners. It’s  totally normal to feel a little intimidated when you first start to  meditate. After all, if you’ve never done it before — you’re not quite  sure what to expect. Listening to a soothing voice (with or without  background music) will help you to relax and become accostomed to the  new sensations that meditation will make you feel.</p>
<br>
<p>Before  you buy a cd or download a guided meditation, it’s important to listen  to a sample first. You need to feel trust in the voice and to find it  pleasant to listen to. You may find that you prefer no music or a  particular type of music.</p>
<br>
<p>Many people who have been meditating for a long time still prefer to use guided meditations.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Healing Meditation">Healing Meditation</h2>
<p>In  his research at Harvard, Herbert Benson demonstrated that meditation is  effective in treating angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias, allergic  skin reactions, anxiety, mild to moderate depression, bronchial asthma,  herpes simplex, cough, constipation, diabetes mellitus, duodenal ulcers,  dizziness, fatigue, hypertension, infertility, insomnia, nausea and  vomiting during pregnancy, nervousness, postoperative swelling,  premenstrual syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, side effects of cancer,  side effects of AIDS, and all forms of pain — backaches, headaches,  abdominal pain, muscle pain, joint aches, postoperative pain, neck, arm,  and leg pain. (Most likely it helps many conditions not listed here,  but Dr. Benson just hasn’t gotten around to studying them yet!)</p>
<br>

<br>
<h2 id="Mantra Meditation">Mantra Meditation</h2>
<p>This is a meditation that is aided by the repitition of a mantra.</p>
<br>
<p>What’s a mantra?</p>
<br>
<p>If you split the word into two parts, you get</p>
<br>
<p><i>man</i> /= the root of the Sanksrit word for mind/</p>
<br>
<p><i>tra</i> /= the root of the word instrument./</p>
<br>
<p>So  a mantra is an instrument of your mind. It can be a phrase, a sound or a  vibration that you repeat and focus on, to help you go into a deeper  state of meditation.</p>
<br>
<p>Three of the most well known mantras for meditation are:</p>
<br>
<p><i>1. Mantra:</i> /OM/</p>
<br>
<p>What it means: The sound of the universe. The first, original vibration. It represents birth, death and re-birth process.</p>
<br>
<p><i>2. Mantra:</i> /Om Namah Shivaya/</p>
<br>
<p>What it means: I bow to Shiva, the supreme deity of transformation who represents the truest, highest self.</p>
<br>
<p><i>3. Mantra:</i> /Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu/</p>
<br>
<p><i>What it means:</i>  May all beings everywhere be happy and free — and may the thoughts,  words and actions of my own life contribute in some way to that  happiness and to that freedom for all.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Meditation for Anxiety and Depression">Meditation for Anxiety and Depression</h2>
<p>Meditation  is ideal for people who suffer from anxiety and depression. This is  because it is a good way to enter a state of relaxation. People who are  anxious, often hyper-ventilate (breathe too fast and not deep enough) so  focussing on slowing down their breathing and making those breaths  deeper is extremely helpful. And if you suffer with depression, it can  be helpful to focus on something to give you a little relief from how  you are feeling.</p>
<br>
<p>If  you are going to meditate to help with anxiety, it’s very important to  remember not to beat yourself up if you imagine you’re somehow ‘doing it  wrong’. There really is no wrong way to meditate. There is only  starting…and continuing. As you continue, you will find the meditation  techniques easier to do and you will get more benefit from them.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Meditation for Beginners">Meditation for Beginners</h2>
<p>When  you’re learning to meditate, it’s important to keep it simple. I would  recommend that you use a guided meditation (see above) and that you only  meditate for five or ten minutes per day to start with.</p>
<br>
<p>One  common fear that most newbies go through, is that they won’t come  back — it’s not like you can set an alarm clock. When I first started  meditating, someone gave me a piece of good advice — before you start,  ask your guide (whether you know them or not…they /will/ be listening) to bring you back after say, five or ten minutes. I was amazed when I ‘woke up’ absolutely to the minute.</p>
<br>
<p>When  you get a few meditations under your belt and you start to go into a  deeper state of relaxation, it can be tempting to stay in that blissful  state for just a little while longer — but if you always use the ‘Spirit  Guide wake up call’ you will always be back exactly when you asked to  be.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="‘Meeting’ Meditations">‘Meeting’ Meditations</h2>
<p>These  are focused on meeting someone particular. This may be your Spirit  Guide, your Guardian Angel or a loved one who has passed over.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Mindful Meditation">Mindful Meditation</h2>
<p>Mindfulness  is a bit of a buzz word at the moment. In order to understand what  Mindful Meditation is, it helps to know what mindfulness is.</p>
<br>
<p>The dictionary defines it as:</p>
<br>
<ol start="1"><li>/the quality or state of being conscious or aware of something./
</li><li>/a  mental state achieved by focusing one’s awareness on the present  moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one’s feelings,  thoughts, and bodily sensations, used as a therapeutic technique./
</li></ol>
<br>
<p>In the Buddhist tradition, mindfulness is nurtured by performing a seated meditation.</p>
<br>
<p>What  makes mindfulness mediation different is that it is not performed to  help you to become any different from how you already are — not more  enlightened, not more relaxed and not more open to spirit communication.</p>
<br>
<p>Instead,  it helps you to become aware of what is already true moment by moment.  It teaches you how to be unconditionally present. That helps you to be  present with whatever is happening, no matter what it is.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Past Life Meditation">Past Life Meditation</h2>
<p>This is usually a guided meditation with the goal of uncovering your past lives.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Reiki Meditation">Reiki Meditation</h2>
<p>Three main meditation techniques for the foundation in the first level of Reiki.</p>
<br>
<ol start="1"><li><i>Kenyoku Hô</i> — /a cleansing meditation./
</li><li><i>Jôshin Kokyû Hô</i> — /a meditation using breathing to focus the mind./
</li><li><i>Seishin Toitsu</i> — /a meditation to unify the mind./
</li></ol>
<br>
<p><i>Hatsurei Hô</i> is a combination of all three above.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="Relaxation Meditation">Relaxation Meditation</h2>
<p>Relaxation  meditation is a very useful tool for helping your to get a good nights’  sleep or to help if you tend to be anxious or depressed.</p>
<br>
<p>In  this form of meditation exercise, music is often used with or without a  guided meditation voiceover. Just as the title describes, relaxation  meditation is aimed at attaining a deep state of relaxation.</p>
<br>
<p>If  you are becoming more advanced with your meditation practice, you may  already be familiar with the wonderful state of feeling utterly,  totally, completely relaxed. Great, isn’t it?</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Simple / Easy Meditation">Simple / Easy Meditation</h2>
<p>These are alternative names for meditation for beginners.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Spiritual Meditation">Spiritual Meditation</h2>
<p>All  types of meditation are spiritual. When you go into a state of deep  relaxation, you allow yourself to connect with a higher power. That  higher power is the omnipresent, the one, the divine, universal  consciousness, God — there are many terms for this and you will find one  that resonates with you and that you are comfortable with.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Themed Meditation">Themed Meditation</h2>
<p>These  are guided meditations that focus on one a subject such as abundance,  forgiveness, improving intuition, mindfulness…you name a subject and you  will be able to find a meditation to help you with it.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Third Eye Meditation">Third Eye Meditation</h2>
<p>In  this meditation, you focus on your third eye. This is the chakra that  is located in the middle of your forehead and it is associated with  psychic seeing or clairvoyance (which translates as clair=clear,  voyance=seeing). As you visualize that beautiful spinning wheel of  energy, you will start to open it up, slowly at first and then as far as  you can go. As you do this, you are also making your own energy vibrate  faster. This makes it easier to tune into spirit as their energy  vibration is much higher than ours.</p>
<br>
<p>The  aim of this meditation is to see…whatever you are blessed to see. You  can go into it with a clear desire to see somebody or something or just  go with the flow and literally see what you are given.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Walking Meditation">Walking Meditation</h2>
<p>This  is simply meditating while you are walking. Many people enjoy this  because it connects them with nature. In fact, people who love to hike  or ramble may already be ‘walking meditators’ without even realising it.  It’s easy and very pleasant to lose yourself in nature and that losing  yourself part is the meditation. It brings the double benefit of  relaxation and exercise.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Yoga and Meditation">Yoga and Meditation</h2>
<p>The  guidebook of classical yoga is called the Yoga Sutra. It was compiled  by a sage called Patanjali, at least 1,700 years ago and comprises 195  sutras or words of wisdom. Patanjali also wrote significant works on  Ayurveda (the ancient Indian system of medicine) and Sanskrit grammar.</p>
<br>
<p>Yoga  has much in common with meditation. They both involve breathing deeply,  focussing, quieting down the outside noise and listening inward. So  yoga and meditation were made for each other.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Zen Meditation">Zen Meditation</h2>
<p>In Buddhism, Zen is called the ‘meditation school’. The type of meditation that is central to Zen Buddhism is called Zazen.</p>
<br>
<p>Zazen is the study of the self.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>/To  study the Buddha Way is to study the self, to study the self is to  forget the self, and to forget the self is to be enlightened by the ten  thousand things./ — Zen Master Dogen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be enlightened by the ten thousand things is to recognize the unity of the self and the ten thousand things.</p>
<br>
<p>Buddah  was in seated meditation when he received his own enlightenment and Zen  practices it to this day. The seated Zen meditation has been used by  Buddhists for more than 2,500 years.</p>
<br>
<p>It spread from India to China, then to Japan and other parts of Asia and then finally to the West.</p>
<br>
<p>It’s  a very simple practice — easy to describe and very easy to follow. But  like all other meditations, you have to perform it regularly to  discover — and benefit from — its power and depth.</p>
