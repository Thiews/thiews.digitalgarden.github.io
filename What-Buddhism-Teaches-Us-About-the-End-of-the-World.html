<p>Recently, over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/27/climate-crisis-6-million-people-join-latest-wave-of-worldwide-protests">six million</a> people around the globe protested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/opinion/climate-change-12-years.html">climate disaster</a>. On Friday, September 20, 2019 over two million people walked out of their schools or workplaces.</p>
<br>
<p>Why? <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/10/08/655360909/grim-forecast-from-u-n-on-global-climate-change">According to scientists</a>, the only way to prevent global temperatures rising above 1.5 degrees is to decrease our carbon emissions by 40% to 50% before 2040. Scientists <a href="http://www.susannemoser.com/documents/Moser_Getting_Real_About_It-preprint.pdf">predict</a> that even two extra degrees of planetary warming will result in a complete disintegration of coral reefs, increased wildfire damage, and put millions at risk of flooding, heat waves, disease, and famine. In addition to reducing emissions, governments must achieve negative emissions in the years following 2040 — and this best case scenario will only give us a 50:50 chance of avoiding unparalleled temperature change. Most experts agree that this is an unrealistic goal, as it would require unprecedented changes in our society and we have not yet instituted the kind of policy changes that are necessary.</p>
<br>
<p>Still, on the day of the Climate March, my professor and schoolmates helped stage a small climate change ceremony in the lobby of the California Institute of Integral Studies, where I am studying to become a therapist. We constructed an “earth altar” on the floor, out of scarves, cloth, stones, bone, plants, and bowls of water. After guiding people to be aware of their bodies, we invited participants to write their feelings about climate change on postcards. In particular, I asked the participants to think about something they would like to mourn: a species of animal, perhaps, or the ice caps. A way of being, a future foreclosed. Then, Buddhist priests chanted a sutra while each person brought their card to the altar.</p>
<br>
<p>Afterward, we mailed the cards to Nancy Pelosi’s office.</p>

<p>In Japan, where I trained for many years as a Buddhist priest, public grief is common and accepted. Ceremonies to honor death involve inscribing a memorial tablet (/oihai/) with the name of the deceased loved one. These /oihai/ are then placed on an altar or grave (usually, there are black lacquered /oihai/ for the family altar in the living room, and wooden /oihai/ on the graves themselves). Families conduct these memorial services on the third, seventh, and 49th days following the person’s death. A monk visits the house to chant, and the family brings fruit, flowers, and the family member’s favorite food to the grave. Following these chanting services, the family will dine together.</p>

<br>
<p>When I was first training to become a priest, I focused all of my attention on learning the details of this ceremony. But after many years spent performing memorial services, I came to see that, for the grieving family, the power of the memorial was not in the sutra’s words themselves but in the whole experience, the immersion into a familiar, communal tradition.</p>

<br>
<p>As a Buddhist clergy member and therapist in training, I often wonder what my role will be in the coming years of climate disaster. I do know a large part of this work will be helping people come to terms with grief.</p>
<br>
<p>In the <a href="https://grief.com/the-five-stages-of-grief/">five stages of grief</a>, denial is the first, followed by anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Personally, there is still part of me that does not accept the reality of climate change, similar to how I have not accepted the inevitability of my own death. Grief counselors know that grief does not follow a set, linear pattern. We do not enter grief through the door of denial and exit, finally and permanently, into acceptance. Grief is cyclical. We skip over and then return to the same state of being. We arrive at acceptance only to be thrown back again into depression and anger.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>In“<a href="http://www.susannemoser.com/documents/Moser_Getting_Real_About_It-preprint.pdf">Getting Real: Meeting the Psychological and Social Demands of a World in Distress</a>,” Susanne C. Moser argues that environmental leaders can help transition our culture into the next era in seven ways: 1) getting real about the grimmest truths of climate disaster; 2) grief work; 3) framing the transition as a transition; 4) growing the capacity to be with people in distress; 5) holding paradox; 6) accountability and amnesty; and 7) non-violence and restoration.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Death is certain. Life is uncertain. I could die anytime, anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaders will need to build their own capacity to face the realities of their own deaths and the death of a species, to facilitate communal grief work, and to experience and give voice to paradoxes: hope as well as fear, gratitude as well as sadness. In an increasingly chaotic world, we will also have to study and practice non-violence. Moser writes, “There will be no survival without the restoration of the ecological fabric or without our neighbors.”</p>
<br>
<p>In her blueprint for environmental leaders, I see many of the same values and skills that already exist within Buddhist communities; a recognition of impermanence is at the heart of Buddhist practice. As a 20-year-old studying Vipassana at a Burmese monastery in India, I was given the following mantra to repeat during meditation: “Death is certain. Life is uncertain. I could die anytime, anywhere.”</p>
<br>
<p>Monks throughout history have meditated in charnel grounds. No matter our tradition, in Buddhist practice we consciously take up the inevitability of our own death not as a downer to ruin our day, but as a way to appreciate the transitory beauty of living. Recognizing and confronting death becomes a way to live more fully. It is also grist for the mill, a motivation to be kinder with ourselves and others. As we enter into a chaotic future, a recognition of this inevitability will go a long way towards soothing our own and others’ suffering.</p>
<br>
<p>“Our practice as Buddhists and chaplains calls us to not turn away from reality,” said Daigan Gaither, a Zen priest who participated in the ceremony. “Our practice is to face head-on the suffering of this climate disaster as well as the way it ties into systems of racism, sexism, classism, and other oppressions.”</p>
<br>
<p>Buddhist clergy are also uniquely suited to hold space for paradox. As Thich Nhat Hanh writes in the opening lines of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Being-Peace-Thich-Nhat-Hanh/dp/188837540X">/Being Peace/</a>, “Life is filled with suffering, but it is also filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, and the eyes of a baby… life is both dreadful and wonderful. To practice meditation is to be in touch with both aspects.”</p>
<br>
<p>By becoming intimate with the true nature of reality, we learn to be tender. We experience ourselves as one drop of water falling from a bird’s beak — flimsy, beautiful, and fleeting. We become comfortable with broken-heartedness and know it as the most true response, since this contains both loss and joy, grief and love.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>We will become who we need to be to give each other light.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>

<br>
<p>Doctors, therapists, healers, activists, community leaders, and clergy have a particular role to play in the coming years of climate disaster. As a Zen priest, I intend to share the values and training I have — the ability to confront death, transition, paradox, and a commitment to non-violence. But we will need more. We will need everyone.</p>
<br>
<p>This week, a researcher interviewed me for a project on women and Buddhism. “Many teachers are worried about the future of Buddhism,” she said. “What do you think Buddhism needs to survive?”</p>
<br>
<p>In her question, I hear the echo of a broader, society-wide question about mortality: How can we survive as a species? Are we really going to die out? For some reason, my response was, “Whatever is useful and true for humanity will survive. Whatever cannot endure, fire will burn.”</p>
<br>
<p>Victor Frankl wrote, “What is to give light must endure burning.”</p>
<br>
<p>I think I am here to tell you: Don’t worry. We will burn completely. There will be immense pain. And we will be what we need for each other. We will become who we need to be to give each other light.</p>
