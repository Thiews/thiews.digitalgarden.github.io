<blockquote>
<p>“Life has no meaning, so why bother doing anything?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thought has /certainly/  occurred to every human being who has ever walked the earth, to varying  degrees. The little voice in your head, questioning the point behind  all of the efforts you make and all of the suffering you endure  throughout your life.</p>
<br>
<p>Most of us seem to be influenced in some way by the philosophy of <i>nihilism</i>, even if we are not aware of it. Every time you think /“what’s the point?”/ or  consider that all of your progress is in vain, because we all die one  day, and none of it will matter, you are wrestling with nihilism, with  your <i>existential suffering.</i></p>
<br>
<p>It  is something that I still have to confront every day, notably when I  sit down to work. There is always that ever-present feeling of what I  like to call /‘existential doubt’,/  laying before me like a mental barrier. This usually hits me a few  times a day, to varying degrees, when I sit down to do some work.</p>
<br>
<p>I  have a notable history with nihilism, as I experienced it to varying  degrees throughout my teenage years, and still have some experiences  with it today. I can guarantee whilst writing this little story for you,  that at some point I questioned the point of writing it.</p>
<br>
<p>However,  as toxic of a philosophy I believe nihilism to be, I regard it as one  of the most important things that happened to me in my life. Going  through nihilism, and coming out the other end of it, shaped me into the  person I am today. My current beliefs, philosophies, and interests are  all influenced by the many years I spent trapped under the heel of  nihilism, and I do believe that my experience with nihilism made me a  much better person.</p>

<h2 id="My Nihilistic Past">My Nihilistic Past</h2>
<p>My  first real encounter with my nihilistic self came back in high school,  at the age of around 15, when I really had to start studying for exams. I  feel like most teens go through a touch of nihilism during high school,  as they study for many exams, few of which will actually serve a  purpose to them in the future. We are often told by parents and teachers  that doing well in our exams was paramount to our success in the  future, but I saw through these claims.</p>
<br>
<p>My /‘enlightenment’/ at  this age to all of this wasn’t exactly a good thing, it just made me  incredibly stubborn. I wouldn’t want to study for my exams because I  felt it was pointless to do so, that I wasn’t actually learning anything  or spending my time productively, but simply shoving facts into my head  that I could splurge back out onto a piece of paper the week after. The  problem at this point was that my nihilism seemed to have a tight grip  on me, meaning I wasn’t doing anything productive at all, but rather  engaging in the many hedonistic activities that all 15 year old boys  love; things like video games, TV, porn and whatnot.</p>
<br>
<p>As  I got older, my nihilistic thoughts only seemed to intensify as I  advanced through the education system. I actually did reasonably well  throughout school, but I don’t put that down to hard work and lots of  studying, but due to a natural ability to remember things easily and a  bundle of skills that I already seemed to possess, that were pretty  important for standardised exams.</p>
<br>
<p>As  the exams got more serious, I seemed to care less. I would spend less  and less time studying for each new set of exams. I was not somebody who  was able to do what people told me to do. Nihilism had its strongest  grip on me at the age of 18, when I had to take my A-levels, which are  the exams here in the UK which determine which university you can get  into. At that time I still believed that I wanted to go to university,  but I simply couldn’t build up any motivation to really study for these  exams. I would study for maybe 1–2 hours per day in the weeks leading up  to the exams, when some of my peers were studying 5–6 hours a day.</p>
<br>
<p>img</p>
<br>
<p>Many thoughts were perpetually racing through my head back then, ranging from /“why should I study for this exam, when I’m not actually learning anything?”/ to /“why should I study for this exam, when I’m going to die some day and none of it will matter?/”</p>
<br>
<p>I didn’t even see the point in going to school. My theory was, “/why should I do this if it’s not pleasurable for me in the moment, when I could just sit at home and play video games?”/</p>
<br>
<p>Nihilism  led me into the deepest pits of despair and depression at times, but I  didn’t seem to realise it at all. I had bought into the idea that life  was meaningless, and everything I was doing at that point in my life was  not helping me in any way, but was simply needless suffering.</p>
<br>
<p>Eventually, I had to decide which was worse; <i>momentary suffering</i> through hard work, or <i>constant existential suffering</i> about my place on the earth.</p>
<br>
<p>img</p>
<br>
<h2 id="How I recovered">How I recovered</h2>
<p>It  was a very long process. I had to completely switch my mindset. For so  long I had been considering the bigger picture of existence itself,  which I deemed to be meaningless, rather than focusing on what I could  do during my life to make it fulfilling, to ensure I made myself and my  loved ones proud.</p>
<br>
<p>I  think, as with all things, the first step away from nihilism is wanting  to be free of it, wanting to change your outlook. This was absurdly  difficult for me, as I had been under the nihilistic spell for years.</p>
<br>
<p>It  is an extremely difficult philosophy to escape. Nihilism offers the  idea that nothing you do has any meaning, and hence you have no  responsibility, you can simply laze around and watch porn all day. The  idea of no responsibility is incredibly attractive to a lot of young  people, which is why there are so many teenagers caught up in nihilism,  along with all the hormones as well, I assume.</p>
<br>
<p>The  first step towards escaping nihilism for me, was shifting my focus from  the overall meaning of existence itself, to a more earthly outlook.  What I mean by this, is that before with everything I did, I had been  taking into account the essential meaning of existence rather than just  getting to work, and I considered existence to be meaningless, so this  held me back from making any real effort.</p>
<br>
<p>I  began trying to focus on what I could do with my life to make myself  and others proud, and to use my pretty advantageous position of being  born in a wealthy western country to actually do something useful for  the good of the world, rather than lazing around feeling sorry for  myself, filled with existential suffering.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="How nihilism made me a better person">How nihilism made me a better person</h2>
<p>Now,  to the whole point of the story. I do believe that my struggles with  nihilism shaped me into a better person, and there are a few reasons why  I believe this to be the case.</p>
<br>
<p>Firstly,  I’ll explain my current philosophy in life. I’m an existentialist, so,  much like in my nihilistic days, I still believe there is no inherent  meaning in life, but I now believe that because of this, there is no  reason not to give everything I have and try to create my own meaning in  this most likely hollow existence.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="Nihilism made me realise how much our thoughts shape our reality.">Nihilism made me realise how much our thoughts shape our reality.</h3>
<p>Through  nihilism, and my slight change in outlook to existentialism, I notice  an enormous difference in almost every aspect of my life. I work harder,  I want to live more, I make more effort in my relationships, and much  more. I accredit a lot of this to the little shift in mindset I had from  nihilism to existentialism. Without a change in the way I think, I may  still be the same nihilistic lazy bum that I was in my teenage years.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="Nihilism made me realise how precious our time is.">Nihilism made me realise how precious our time is.</h3>
<p>Upon  waking up from my nihilist possession, I began to contemplate how  important our time is, and what we choose to do with it. I began  thinking about every hour that passed, and asking myself if what I did  in that hour was worthwhile. I started trying to spend my time either  doing something productive, or something that brought me joy. I try not  to waste time watching YouTube or Netflix for hours on end, and if I do  end up watching some TV to relax a little, I’m much more present and  aware of how much time I’m spending on it.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="Nihilism made me want to be a better person.">Nihilism made me want to be a better person.</h3>
<p>Once  I had escaped nihilism’s stranglehold, I realised I had wasted a lot of  time throughout my teenage years, and hadn’t really developed myself in  any way. So I started to really get into self-improvement. I took up  meditation, yoga, a healthy lifestyle, and really started to make much  more of an effort with everything I did.</p>
<br>
<p>img</p>
<br>
<p>Fast  forward to the present, and I believe this switch in outlook has given  me a much healthier relationship with work, with how I spend my time,  and has locked away those nihilistic thoughts in the darkest corners of  my brain.</p>
<br>
<p>They  do still pay me a visit every now and then, but they no longer have the  power to put me out of action for hours, or days at a time. I now have a  much better relationship with myself, my existence, and those  nihilistic demons which, these days, surface once in a blue moon.</p>
