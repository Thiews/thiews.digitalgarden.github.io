<p>Le 01/04/2019</p>
<br>
<p>What do the Zen masters and mystics know that we don’t?</p>
<p>The world we inhabit is made up of things. Things fill our goals and desires, occupy our to-do lists and furnish our households. We block off our days with things to do and our nights with things to see and hear. It is near impossible to imagine no-thing beyond just being the absence of some-thing.</p>
<p>Is there a way to get a glimpse of that no-thing-ness that Zen masters, mystics and witchy grandmothers hint at — the no-thing that is larger than just the absence of some-thing? And why would we want to?</p>
<p>Do the mystics hold knowledge reaching beyond our mundane days of chores and diversions — some deeper insight into the ultimate meaning of things and no-things? I’ve learned it’s best to find those deeper answers to the larger questions through personal experience rather than from someone else’s words. Words are things too.</p>
<br>
<p>I entered the field-less field of no-thing-ness for a few timeless moments . . . one time. I briefly became aware of that energetic of emptiness that permeates the aliveness of all things. And I was changed in those fleeting moments, as a mystical experience can do to a person. Seems the witchy grandmothers may be on to some <i>thing</i>.</p>
<p>When I was attending art school I was given an assignment to draw the negative space around the leaves of a tree. It was a different approach to drawing some-thing, drawing the empty space around it that defined its edges.</p>
<p>I chose a single lower branch of a small tree that had plenty of detail and put my attention onto the space surrounding the leaves instead of the leaves themselves. It was a radically different way of looking at some-thing, by focusing my attention on the no-thing-ness surrounding and outlining it.</p>
<p>As I drew the vacant space the leaves slowly emerged, like things arising from a mysterious emptiness of infinite possibility.</p>
<p>For some precious seconds, I lost myself in the <i>flow</i>of my moving pencil as it captured the space of no-thing. It was a most unusual focus of my attention, pulling me from the deep grooves of my customary perceptual modalities. Within the act of drawing no-thing, I awakened to a much larger view. Every-thing became very small in that expansive no-thing-ness.</p>
<br>
<p><i>What a wonderful metaphor for how we humans are created, mysteriously arising as living things from the greatest mystery of no-thing-ness.</i></p>
<br>
<p>That early sunny morning, in those time-less moments, I was fully aware, fully functional and working at my task without the shadow of a thought. It was the most present I had ever been. Perhaps I stumbled into the mind of no-mind that those crazy Zen teachers laugh about. I felt myself as space, like the space defining the leaves. The normally chatty internal dialogue, usually a constant presence, was nudged into silence by this unfamiliar way of perceiving the world. I was fully in the know and abiding the greatest mystery in the exact same instant. I had mindlessly stumbled into an incredible feeling of spiritual delight that I imagined to be the lightning bolt of <i>satori</i>. It was an awesome string of timeless moments.</p>
<p>The delight left as quickly as it had arrived as I started interpreting and defining it. I continued to draw anyway, enjoying the cosmic afterglow resulting from this unique practice for attaining what I later understood to be the perfection of mindfulness.</p>
<p>When completed, the drawing was definitely a drawing of leaves on a branch. Funny how the mind always wants to get back to the known of things. At no time was I drawing the leaves, and yet the leaves wound up there on the paper, described by space surrounding them that was captured by my pencil.</p>
<p>What a wonderful metaphor for how we humans are created, mysteriously arising as living things from the greatest mystery of no-thing-ness. I like to believe that while drawing the space around those leaves I discovered the core truth of our authentic selves as no-thing in particular, as unending waves of possibility out of which we and all the things of our life continually emerge.</p>
<br>
<p><i>Opening up to that larger world of presence is how we begin to know that larger part of ourselves that is just below the surface busyness of life.</i></p>
<br>
<p>I carry the feelings of that art class to this day and am grateful beyond saying, though I still don’t pretend at understanding. I don’t believe understanding is required and is probably impossible, anyway. I guess that’s the spiritual crux of things. The spiritually wise speak of developing an ability to give up the known and abiding in the bottomless mystery of things and the no-thing-ness from which they emerge, without freaking out too much. If we can do this, then, they say, we shall come to know spiritual delight as our natural state of being.</p>
<p>A friend once shared a practice she learned from the spiritual teacher, Eckhart Tolle, about listening for the silences out of which the sounds of the world emerge. This is similar to becoming aware of the space defining a branch of leaves. My friend said she loved walking on a bustling city street filled with the noise of life and listening for the silence out of which all that bustle rises. She assures me it is there, though subtle, like a hummingbird’s hum. It just takes a settled, present mind to notice it.</p>
<p>These intentional shifts in the way we perceive our world are gateways for entering the perfection of mindfulness, becoming alive to the largeness of life that is usually unnoticed because of our busy brains focused on our stories, chores, and diversions. Opening up to that larger world of presence is how we begin to know that larger part of ourselves that is just below the surface busyness of life.</p>
<p>Any teacher worth their salt is good at setting up situations that force us to leave our perceptual comfort zones. In retrospect, I believe that art teacher who had taken us outside to draw the empty spaces of no-thing-ness was not an art teacher at all. She was actually a wild and witchy grandmother disguised as an art teacher. She showed me what had always been there, surrounding the leaves and all the other things of life, always defining them, despite my lack of noticing. And she hinted at how that no-thing-ness ultimately defined me as well.</p>
<p>I was much younger when I took that class. I wish I understood the depth of what she was teaching at the time. I often wonder at all the lessons I may have missed during that semester as her student. But we get what we get when we’re ready to get it I guess. And, thanks to her, I am able to appreciate the virtue of no-thing and settling my mind to be able to perceive its powerful presence within all the things of this world.</p>
