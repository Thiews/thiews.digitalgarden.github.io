<p><i>The need for mental clarity and logical consistency</i></p>
<br>
<p>Thinking is the handmaiden of organised knowledge.</p>
<p>It’s the foundation of everything we do, but we rely largely on automatic and unconscious thinking to process information, often resulting in misunderstandings and errors.</p>
<p>All other factors being equal, people with superior knowledge solve problems better and make better judgements than those with deficient knowledge. This is due to the level of established thought patterns they’ve built over the years.</p>
<p>True thinkers continually deepen their mastery of the basics — they acquire new knowledge, modify existing knowledge, and sometimes disregard old knowledge as irrelevant.</p>
<p>More often than not, it’s not what we don’t know that gets us in trouble or lead to the path of life-changing mistakes, it’s what we do know and what we do with it. Improving how we think can help us make better and choices.</p>
<p>When was the last time you thought about how you think?</p>
<p>Effective thinkers do not accept information at face value. They also avoid jumping to conclusions and rushing to judgment. They constantly create questions to clarify and extend their understanding.</p>
<p>The key is to see and understand multiple viewpoints, analyse them objectively and make a rational choice based on existing and new knowledge. A desire to think critically about even the simplest of issues can lead to better and objective outcomes.</p>
<br>
<p><i>@Note</i> : Chaque assertion doit être critiquée et non acceptée aveuglément</p>
<p>Edward B. Burger, author of The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking says we should refuse to accept assertions blindly. He encourages us to challenge everything. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You are the best authority on what you don’t understand — trust yourself: don’t be afraid to ask the questions you need to ask, and be brave enough to change your thinking when you uncover a blind spot.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="Lessons From René Descartes And Charles Darwin">Lessons From René Descartes And Charles Darwin</h3>
<p>René Descartes, a French philosopher, mathematician and scientist who has routinely been called the father of modern philosophy, argues that “If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things.”</p>
<br>
<p><i>@Note</i> : Règle de pensée de Descartes pour régler des problèmes de cognition</p>
<p>Descartes solved problems of cognition using his four famous rules of thought as described in Rules for the Direction of the Mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“(1) accept nothing as true that is not self-evident, (2) divide problems into their simplest parts, (3) solve problems by proceeding from simple to complex, and (4) recheck the reasoning.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shifting over to effective thinking means thinking purposefully using a framework and toolset that can lead to better decisions, and faster problem-solving in life and career.</p>
<p>Charles Darwin was an incredibly organised collector of information. He was not afraid to challenge his existing beliefs and knowledge.</p>
<p>In his autobiography Darwin writes:</p>
<p>“I had, also, during many years, followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from memory than favorable ones.</p>
<p>His Origin of Species, a comprehensive thought piece, revolutionised the course of science and continues to transform our views of the world. Darwin’s extraordinary breadth of curiosity led to amazing discoveries. He pursued knowledge with an open mind.</p>
<p>He once argued, “…it appears to me, the doing what little one can to increase the general stock of knowledge is as respectable an object of life, as one can in any likelihood pursue.”</p>
<p>Darwin thought broadly and carefully, especially during his contemplative walks. While working on his famous theory of evolution, Darwin took daily walks, to exercise his mind and body, to think, and most importantly to observe and notice nature.</p>
<p>Walking the same route each day from his house, through shady woods Darwin referred to this as his ‘thinking path’. He took every opportunity, no matter where he was to engage in productive thinking.</p>
<p>A healthy and effective mental life is often accompanied by time for undisturbed contemplation. Famous non-fictional thinkers made time to think about pressing problems.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein played the violin during times of productive thinking, claiming that it was in some ways an extension of his thinking and that it helped him to solve particularly tricky problems.</p>
<p>Mozart claimed that many of his best musical ideas came while he was walking or riding in a carriage.</p>
<p>In everything you do, aim to refine your outcomes through deliberate and productive thinking. As you ponder, reflect, observe, visualise, imagine possibilities and engage in thought experiments, you will find new insights.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“In everything you do, refine your skills and knowledge about fundamental concepts and simple cases. Once is never enough. As you revisit fundamentals, you will find new insights. It may appear that returning to basics is a step backward and requires additional time and effort; however, by building on firm foundations you will soon see your true abilities soar higher and faster,” writes Burger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world’s greatest thinkers continue to hone their reasoning. As our world keeps changing, it is likely that we will all need to develop some of the wisdom and genius of people like Einstein, Darwin and Descartes. Effective thinking.</p>
<p>To learn how to think effectively requires the openness to think beyond our established ideas and the curiosity to keep ourselves in wonder at all times. Remember, great thinkers are just ordinary people who use their minds differently — and that could be you.</p>
