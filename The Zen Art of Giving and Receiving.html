<p>Le 8/03/2019</p>
<br>
<p>People are always talking and writing about giving. In business articles and in personal growth articles and videos you will hear about how important it is to give something back, to contribute or to “be a giver”.</p>
<br>
<p>I think this is probably great advice, there are a lot of people out there who don’t give anything to anyone. They tend to be caught up in self too much, trying to figure out what’s up with their lives and how to get more of something they want.</p>
<br>
<p>I know, in business the “give something back” advice could only be attached to the idea that the giving would cause people to like you and do more business with you. It’s more about the art of reciprocation than honest heart-felt giving.</p>
<br>
<p>Zen practice is full of little ideas that a reader can skim over whilst reading the latest zen book. One of them that shouldn’t be skimmed over, is about learning to /give and receive a gift/. It’s an interesting practice. Not many of us are really brought up to think about what it means to present someone with a gift. Therefore, we don’t spend much time considering what we should and should not feel when we do this simple act.</p>
<br>
<p>And it’s not really about having a feeling, either. The advice is to practise and observe what happens inside of yourself when you give a present to another person. Even when we give a birthday present to a family member it can lead to interesting insights into our emotional reactions.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Ego is the problem">Ego is the problem</h2>
<p>When your birthday comes round, do you gleefully expect gifts? Those self-centred feelings of, “it’s my turn now!”, tend to get brushed aside as allowable blips in our otherwise selfless lives. It’s how we were taught. If it’s your birthday, you’re allowed a little bit of “me, me, me” time.</p>
<br>
<p>When we give, and I can only really reflect on what I observe in myself, we also experience feelings of expectant gratitude, to be rewarded, and to be praised for our actions.</p>
<br>
<p>We could say, that’s just being human, right? But really, it’s being egoistic. And that can be the problem. Ego creates a kind of blindness in the person who happily presents a gift to another person. This blindness of the inner eyes is what will cause you to miss out on witnessing the joy of another person.</p>
<br>
<p>The gift should create joy, and we should observe it. And according to zen, which is a pretty well thought out philosophy, we can reflect that person’s joy in our own hearts. That sounds a hell of lot cooler than the selfish method of wanting to be praised for giving.</p>
<br>
<p>Try it out next time you offer a person something. It can be as mundane as you inviting a friend to a cup of coffee or to giving a few bucks to a beggar.</p>
<br>
<p>When you give something because you have decided to help, observe the rising thoughts in your mind. New thoughts are there, always rising after an action. Observe which thoughts appear first, is it expectations that the person receiving from you will now show gratitude? Or, feelings of self-praise, a pat on the back with your own hand, a grin on your lips?</p>
<br>
<p>All it takes from us at this moment is to become embroiled in those thoughts. To look inwards and forget the person in front of us. We will forget them momentarily when we allow ourselves to become overwhelmed by those rising thoughts, “she deserves it, I can afford it”, or “I’m lucky and I have money, I can give him two dollars. It won’t hurt me.”</p>
<br>
<p>To have a grin on the lips or feel good is a good thing. But where the grin comes from is important if we want to be real humans, to experience life with a fully conscious mind.</p>
<br>
<p>A smile after a helpful action towards another seems justified, but to know that the smile is really due to a feeling of pumping up our self-worth by paying for others, offering lunch, and giving a poor person about 00, 0001 % of our total monetary worth, really does boil down to a selfish action.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Giving is an Art">Giving is an Art</h2>
<p>There is no quick fix in zen practice. It’s about observing our actions and learning from them. To understand actions we must observe thoughts that stem from action and come after actions.</p>
<br>
<p>Hopefully we have been blessed with intelligence that allows us to apply our learning and to understand that to experience the joy that another human feels when receiving a gift is different to the feelings that we desire.</p>
<br>
<p>To understand that their ‘joy’ doesn’t belong to us. It is not my experience, it is theirs — the receivers.</p>
<br>
<p>Ego dictates that we also receive something back when we give. Ego can’t survive without being stroked and praised constantly. So, according to the zen master, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHdcpVEN1Yc">Taisen Deshimaru</a> , when we learn to recognise and discriminate between egoistic thinking and pure thoughts of humanness, then we are making progress as human beings. I agree with him.</p>
<br>
<p>To receive is a similar problem as giving.We receive something that is given with the heart — and then we fumble and bow in gratitude, we don’t know what to say to show how grateful we really are. These feelings and actions are real, but they are mixed up, egoistic thoughts which destroy a moment, that is often repeated, which could always be observed with the words, “thank you”.</p>
<br>
<p>Imagine, you receive a gift. You smile and say thank you, the giver then appears to want more from you, they are not satisfied with your response. You now feel selfish and so begin to fumble for words that could ingratiate the ‘giver’ of the present.</p>
<br>
<p>The receiver has a responsibility to be truthful with their actions, so does the giver of the gift. Both seem to create a total mess of the situation by following social expectations and ignoring the possibility that it could be a joyous moment for both people, if only we practised being conscious of the moment.</p>
